# Swap

Swapping is the bread and butter of CoW Protocol! Let's swap some tokens!

## Select tokens

Consider an example swapping 0.05 `WETH` for `COW`.

When you do a swap on CoW Swap for the first time, you must give approval for the [`GPv2VaultRelayer`](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core#gpv2vaultrelayer) contract to spend your token (in this case, `WETH`). 
This is because [`GPv2VaultRelayer`](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core#gpv2vaultrelayer) is the contract that will pull the `WETH` from our wallet and send it to the [settlement](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core#gpv2settlement) contract that will co-ordinate the swap on your behalf.
Both contracts are audited, battle-tested and non-upgradeable.
Moreover, the settlement contract is the only address that can request the relayer to pull your funds and only after verifying both that your order was signed by you and that you will receive at least your limit execution price or better. 

## Approve sell token

:::tip

Some tokens, such as `USDC`, `DAI`, and `COW` support permit-style approvals. This means that you can approve the [`GPv2VaultRelayer`](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core#gpv2vaultrelayer) to spend your tokens without having any initial gas for an on-chain transaction. This is a great way to save on gas costs!

You don't have to worry about this, as CoW Swap will automatically detect if the token supports permit-style approvals and will guide you through the process.

By default, CoW Swap prompts you to give [`GPv2VaultRelayer`](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core#gpv2vaultrelayer) an "unlimited" allowance for the sell token.
This has the benefits of:

- Not having to re-approve every time you trade
- Saving on gas costs

Once the `approve` transaction is confirmed, you can proceed to swap!

## Confirm swap

When you're ready to swap, click the "Swap" button. You will be prompted to confirm the swap. This is when you can review the details of the swap (ie. the quote, the slippage tolerance, etc.). If you're happy with the details, click "Confirm Swap". You will be prompted to sign the intent to swap.

![Confirm Swap](/img/cowswap/swap_confirm.png)

At this stage, your wallet will prompt you to sign the intent to swap. The user interface for this will vary depending on your wallet.

![Signing Swap](/img/cowswap/swap_signing.png)

Once the intent has been signed, it will be submitted to CoW Protocol.
You are able to [view your order on CoW Explorer](/cow-protocol/tutorials/cow-explorer).
