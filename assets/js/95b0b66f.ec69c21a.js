This is because the design of Constant Function Market Makers (CFMM) does not allow for trading to occur simultaneously in a block. In order for CFMM to work, it needs to process transactions in sequential order, so that the pool can know what is the ratio of tokens in it, and execute the trades with prices accordingly to it. Even though the block will have multiple trades of the same token pairs, each trade will obtain a different price depending on the order in which they trade against the pool. Because of this, the ordering of transactions becomes highly important, and as a consequence, we have seen the rise of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) where the miners freely decide in what order the trades arrive at the pool. Therefore favoring some trades in comparison to others, and ignoring the truthful order of arrival. Batch Auctions allow the trades within a batch to have the same uniform clearing price and therefore there's no point in miners reordering the trades. With CoW Protocol leveraging Batch Auctions, traders in Ethereum can now get the same price for the same token pairs they trade at the exact same block."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Besides being able to establish a uniform clearing price across the trades that happen within a batch, CoW Protocol Batch Auction price finding mechanism is also designed to offer a better price that no other CFMM can offer. Liquidity fragmentation is a big problem within the DeFi space that forces users to be constantly checking what pools can give the best prices for their trades. Batch Auctions are one way to solve the liquidity fragmentation problem as they allow CoW Protocol to offer the traders the chance to be part of a CoW (Coincidence of Wants) to share the liquidity amongst their orders, and in the event that with those orders they still not have enough liquidity, then pair the excess trades with the on-chain liquidity that can give them the best price. Essentially, the idea behind Batch Auctions and CoWs is to turn the protocol into a gigantic barter economy, where users can either trade directly against each other or go to specialized markets to execute what they couldn't barter in a peer to peer fashion."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But the best thing is that batch auctions allow the protocol the ability to combine off-chain interactions (COWs) with on-chain interactions, all in the same transaction."}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)("figure",{children:[(0,n.jsx)("img",{src:"../img/Batch auctions.png",alt:""}),(0,n.jsx)("figcaption",{})]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The amount of batches the protocol executes depends on the trading frequency users choose.
